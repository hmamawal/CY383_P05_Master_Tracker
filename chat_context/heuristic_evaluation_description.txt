### What is Heuristic Evaluation?

**Heuristic evaluation** is a usability inspection method where one or more **experts** review a user interface (such as a website) to identify **usability issues** based on a set of established usability principles called **heuristics**. It does **not involve users** directly and can be done early in the design process or on a finished product.

This method was developed by **Jakob Nielsen** in the early 1990s and remains widely used because it is **quick, cost-effective**, and can uncover a broad range of usability problems.

### Revised Nielsen's Heuristics (2014)

When evaluating a website, reviewers commonly apply the following 10 heuristics:

1. **Visibility of system status** – Keep users informed about what’s going on (e.g., loading indicators).
2. **Match between system and real world** – Use familiar language and logical flows.
3. **User control and freedom** – Provide undo/redo options and avoid trapping users.
4. **Consistency and standards** – Follow platform/web conventions; don’t surprise users.
5. **Error prevention** – Minimize the chance of errors with constraints or confirmations.
6. **Recognition rather than recall** – Reduce memory load by showing options and guides.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** – Include shortcuts or power features for experienced users.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** – Keep interfaces clean; remove unnecessary elements.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** – Clear error messages with solutions.
10. **Help and documentation** – Provide helpful guidance that is easy to find and follow.

### How to Perform a Heuristic Evaluation on a Website

#### 1. **Plan the Evaluation**

* **Define scope**: Which pages or features will be evaluated?
* **Select heuristics**: Use Nielsen’s or any modified set specific to web or mobile.
* **Recruit evaluators**: Ideally 3–5 usability experts to uncover most issues.
* **Set a rating scale**: For instance, 0 (no problem) to 4 (usability catastrophe).

#### 2. **Brief Evaluators**

* Give a short intro and clarify goals.
* Explain the rating system and heuristics.

#### 3. **Individual Evaluation (1–2 hours)**

* **First pass**: Explore the website freely to get a sense of it.
* **Second pass**: Systematically go through the interface and evaluate based on each heuristic.
* Record:

  * Where the issue is
  * What heuristic it violates
  * Severity rating
  * Comments or screenshots

#### 4. **Debriefing Session**

* Review findings as a group.
* **Prioritize issues** based on severity and impact.
* Compile into a report with:

  * Summary of findings
  * List of issues, heuristics violated, severity ratings
  * Recommendations for improvement

### Advantages

* Fast and relatively inexpensive
* Can be used early in design
* Does not require user recruitment

### Limitations

* Requires experienced evaluators
* May miss real-world context issues
* Tends to uncover many minor issues ("false alarms")
